/// <c>pip install lxml</c> out of habit, before <c>import lxml</c>; on this platform the

/// request to the index found nothing but compiled wheels and refused it — in words
/// that told the model lxml was unavailable on a phone where it had been importable
/// the whole time. Observed: a deck that became an HTML file. So a request for a
/// distribution the bundle already ships is reported as already there, and a request
